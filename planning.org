* things to work on

** better progress output

periodically output processed %d of %d packages (or percent done, or something).

ideally don't just update this every time a new package is completed?
Maybe try and avoid spamming the console too often?  Also, if there
hasn't been anything changed in a while, perhaps reassure them that
something is still going on.  (maybe based on the size of the make
stdout/stderr files?)

** Don't depend on pacman

Do it all in-process using alpm

** investigate batching pkginfo requests to AUR
